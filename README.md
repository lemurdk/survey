# ODK-X Survey

This project is __*actively maintained*__

**ODK-X Survey** is an Android application for performing data collection in the ODK-X framework.
It is based on HTML, CSS, and Javascript rather than native Android, and is more flexible in its presentation and execution.

It is part of the ODK-X Android tools suite.

## Setting up your environment

General instructions for setting up an ODK-X environment can be found at our [Developer Environment Setup wiki page](https://github.com/odk-x/tool-suite-X/wiki/Developer-Environment-Setup)

Install [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html) and the [SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other).

This project depends on ODK-X's [androidlibrary](https://github.com/odk-x/androidlibrary) and [androidcommon](https://github.com/odk-x/androidcommon) projects; their binaries will be downloaded automatically fom our maven repository during the build phase. If you wish to modify them yourself, you must clone them into the same parent directory as survey. Your directory structure should resemble the following:

        |-- odk-x

            |-- androidcommon

            |-- androidlibrary

            |-- survey


  * Note that this only applies if you are modifying the library projects. If you use the maven dependencies (the default option), the projects will not show up in your directory.

ODK-X [Service](https://github.com/odk-x/services) __MUST__ be installed on your device, whether by installing the APK or by cloning the project and deploying it. [Tables](https://github.com/odk-x/tables) also integrates well with ODK-X Survey, but is not required.

Now you should be ready to build.

## Building the project

Open the Survey project in Android Studio. Select `Build->Make Project` to build the app.

## Running

Be sure to install ODK-X Core onto your device before attempting to run Survey.
